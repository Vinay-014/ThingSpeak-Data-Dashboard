# Medical Data Dashboard

This web ineterface built for displaying health data collected from a ThingSpeak channel. The dashboard shows the maximum recorded values for **Heart Rate**, **Glucose Levels**, **Temperature**, and **Acetone** levels, all in a interface.

## Features
- Displays maximum values of key health metrics:
  - Heart Rate (bpm)
  - Glucose (mg/dL)
  - Temperature (Â°C)
  - Acetone (ppm)
- Data fetched directly from ThingSpeak using **ThingSpeak API**.

## How It Works
The dashboard pulls data from a **ThingSpeak channel** using the API, processes it to calculate the maximum values for each parameter, and then displays the results in a neat and visually appealing table.
